## About Me

I'm a self-taught developer who enjoys using his computer of doing productive things. I was always really passionate about computers from the tender age of 10. It all started when my parents bought me a brand new desktop computer.

I didn't know what internet was back then, I just used to mess around on my computer by creating doodles on paint and playing those retro in-build Windows XP games.

## The Journey ⚓

Learning to code on your own comes with its own sets of challenges, such as not know how to start learning or what to learn in the first place. It is the persistent effort and determination that gave me the opportunity to look at the other side of the wall.

I started to learn programming because I had a dream to create my own company someday and in pursuit of that goal I found a new hobby. I quickly developed a passion for programming, which has transformed into an obsession.

The first ever programming language that I learned was JavaScript. Even though it not a perfect language (nothing is perfect!), it has a few core design errors.
