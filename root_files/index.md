## About Me

I'm a self-taught developer who enjoys using his computer of doing productive things. I was always really passionate about computers from the tender age of 10. It was when my father bought me a brand new desktop computer.

I didn't know what internet was back then, I just used to mess around on my computer by creating doodles on paint and playing those retro in-build Windows XP games.
