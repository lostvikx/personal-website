I am a student at ITM Business School pursuing PGDM in FinTech Batch 21-23. I was lucky to get an opportunity to work for an NGO called DBM India, provided by ITM Business School. I got to conduct English classes for Para Nursing students.</p><h2 id="about-dbm-india"><a href="#about-dbm-india" class="topic">About DBM India</a></h2><p>Dharma Bharathi Mission (DBM) India is a humanitarian organization working to create lasting change in the lives of children, families and communities living in poverty and injustice. Its mission is to empower the beneficiaries by creating awareness and opportunities in education and employment.</p><blockquote><p class="quote">NGO Model: This is their ‚Äò3E‚Äô model - Empower, Educate, and Employment.

I also tried to incorporate personality development, confidence-building activities and working on the pacing of their speech.</p><p>I covered these topics with the use of a mixture of traditional and modern teaching techniques so that the classes didn‚Äôt become monotonous. These included presentations, classroom discussion, solving worksheets, reading passages, class activities, watching short explanation videos and movies to learn the English language.</p><h2 id="a-few-things-i-got-to-learn-during-this-internship"><a href="#a-few-things-i-got-to-learn-during-this-internship" class="topic">A few things I got to learn during this Internship</a></h2><p>The importance of giving back to the community.

I got to learn the core basics of what builds the English language.</p><h2 id="my-experience-during-the-internship"><a href="#my-experience-during-the-internship" class="topic">My Experience during the Internship</a></h2><ul><li>I enjoyed the journey of teaching students the English language.</li><li>I was delighted to see our students‚Äô progress within these two weeks.</li><li>I could see myself getting better at teaching as time went on.</li><li>Got to learn the basics of the English language.</li><li>Conducting interactive classes allowed the students to open up, this increased their self-confidence.</li><li>I got to empower my students so that they achieve their dreams.</li><li>Seeing the students' determination to learn, motivated me to learn new things as well.</li></ul><h2 id="appreciations"><a href="#appreciations" class="topic">Appreciations</a></h2><p>Thank you to Dharma Bharathi Mission for giving me such an amazing opportunity to work and learn through teaching. Also, a huge thanks to ITM Business School for providing me with an NGO internship opportunity.</p></div>
