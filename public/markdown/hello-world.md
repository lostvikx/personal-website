# Hello, World
 
My name is Vikram Singh Negi, a self-taught developer who likes to hack his laptop. The way you move is so good. This is because ReactJS has states, we used it to store previous move data (record history).

Holly shit!

Programming is my true calling!

## Weather & Air Quality

This project is hosted on Heroku, here is the [link](https://weather-and-air-quality.herokuapp.com/).

This project took quite a while to build, along the way I discovered various caching strategies which are implemented on front-end, web-browsers, and back-end, proxy servers.

This project was made possible by multiple diffrent JavaScript libraries and public APIs.
* Leaflet.js
* Express.js
* [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
* [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org/)

The website is a simple way to get weather and air quality data from a number of different locations around the globle.
